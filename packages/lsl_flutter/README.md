A high-level Flutter plugin for working with the [Lab Streaming Layer (LSL)](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer), designed to make real-time data streaming easy and accessible in Flutter apps.

This package wraps the low-level [`lsl_bindings`](https://pub.dev/packages/lsl_bindings) bindings to provide a simplified and idiomatic Flutter/Dart API for developers who want to stream or record physiological signals (like EEG, PPG, ECG), behavioral data, or any custom time-series streams using LSL.

## âœ¨ Features

- Discover LSL streams on the local network
- Resolve streams by properties (e.g., name, type)
- Push samples/chunks via LSL outlets
- Pull samples/chunks via LSL inlets
- Optional automatic clock synchronization
- Cross-platform (macOS, Windows, Android, iOS)

Powered by native bindings via [`lsl_ffi`](https://pub.dev/packages/lsl_ffi) and made user-friendly for Flutter developers.

## Platform Support

| Android | iOS | MacOS | Windows |
| :-----: | :-: | :---: | :-----: |
|   âœ…    | âœ…  |  âœ…   |   âœ…    |

## ðŸš€ Getting started

Before using `lsl_flutter`, ensure you are targeting a platform supported by both Flutter and LSL (i.e., not web).

Install via `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  lsl_flutter: ^0.0.5
```

## Android

The minimum SDK version must be set to 26 in `app/build.gradle`. This is due to the logging library used by LSL, Loguru.

```java
// app/build.gradle
minSdk = 26
```

The `AndroidManifest.xml` must contain

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE" />
```

This package uses the [carp_multicast_lock](https://pub.dev/packages/carp_multicast_lock) plugin to acquire and release multicast locks on Android.

## iOS

Minimum deployment target must be set to at least 14

```ruby
# Uncomment this line to define a global platform for your project
platform :ios, '14.0'
```

The `Info.plist` for applications using the plugin must specify a reason for accessing the local network

```xml
<key>NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs local network access to discover data streams.</string>
```

Furthermore, the entitlement `com.apple.developer.networking.multicast` must be applied for from Apple with a justification in order to discover streams on iOS devices. This can take several working days.

`Runner*.entitlements` must therefore include the following

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <!--...-->
    <key>com.apple.developer.networking.multicast</key>
    <true />
    <!--...-->
  </dict>
</plist>

```

## macOS

The same entitlement as in [iOS](#iOS) must be granted or the app can be de-sandboxed as illustrated in the image below.

## ðŸ“¦ Usage

The package facilitates various levels of abstraction.

The package exposes three manager classes, one for _inlets_, one fore _outlets_ and one for _stream_ discovery and creation. Creating an outlet and pushing a sample can be achieved in the following way:

```dart
// Create a stream information object for PPG data that will have integer samples, 4 channels,
// and a nominal sampling rate of 135 Hz
final streamInfo = StreamInfoFactory.createIntStreamInfo(
    "Test PPG", "PPG", Int64ChannelFormat(),
    channelCount: 4, nominalSRate: 135, sourceId: deviceId);

// Create an outlet manager with the stream information, this furthermore opens the outlet
// Optional parameters are `outletChunkSize` (default 0) and `outletMaxBuffered ` (default 360)
final manager = OutletManager(streamInfo);

manager.pushSample([1, 2, 3, 4]);
```

To discover streams, a stream manager can be created

```dart
// Create a stream manager
final streamManager = StreamManager();

// Resolve the available streams on the network
final resolvedStreams = streamManager.resolve();

// Create an inlet to the first found stream
final inletManager = streamManager.createInlet(resolvedStreams[0]);

// Pull the next available sample from the stream
final sample = inletManager.pullsSample();
```

For convenience a Dart stream can be created on the inlet manager that emits available samples based on the nominal sampling rate of the LSL stream.

```dart
// Start a sample stream and listen
final subscription = inletManager.startSampleStream().listen((sample) {
  log("Sample: ${sample.$1}");
  log("Timestamp: ${sample.$2}");
});
```

As the underlying plugin relies on foreign function interfaces, this code by default runs synchronously and may block the main thread in some cases, especially when working with inlets. Therefore the package provides two isolate workers, one for inlets and one for outlets.

```dart
// --- Outlet ---
// Create a stream information object for PPG data that will have integer samples, 4 channels,
// and a nominal sampling rate of 135 Hz
final streamInfo = StreamInfoFactory.createIntStreamInfo(
    "Test PPG", "PPG", Int64ChannelFormat(),
    channelCount: 4, nominalSRate: 135, sourceId: deviceId);

// Spawn an outlet isolate worker
final worker = await OutletWorker.spawn();

// Add a new stream outlet
final success = await worker.addStream(streamInfo);

// Push a sample to the newly created outlet
await worker.pushSample("Test PPG", sample);

// --- Outlet ---
// Spawn an inlet worker
final worker = await InletWorker.spawn();

// Resolve available streams on the network
final handles = await worker.resolveStreams() ?? [];

// Open an inlet on the first resolved stream and make LSL handle postprocessing synchronization automatically
final opened = await worker.open(handles[0].id, synchronize: true);

// Create a Dart stream for the inlet
final stream = await worker.startSampleStream(inlet);

// Listen to sample stream
stream?.listen((sample) {
  log("Sample: ${sample.$1}");
  log("Timestamp: ${sample.$2}");
});
```

## Documentation

The documentation of classes and methods are heavily inspired by the documentation of the [LSL Java interface](https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/liblsl-Java). Some documentation is taken directly from there and adapted for Dart.
